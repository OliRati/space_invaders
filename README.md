# 👾 A Tribute to Space Invaders

This project is a reinterpretation of the famous **Space Invaders** game, developed in pure JavaScript with HTML5 and CSS. It is part of my **Retro Computing** universe and will be integrated into my Retrosystem interface.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reproduce the classic game mechanics (movement, shooting, enemies, score)
- Use the HTML5 canvas for graphic rendering
- Handle keyboard events and collisions
- Create an immersive experience in a retro environment

## 🧰 Technologies

- HTML5 `<canvas>`
- JavaScript (DOM, game loop, events)
- CSS (pixel art, animations)

## 🔗 Planned Integration

This game will be integrated as an application in my [Retrosystem](https://github.com/OliRati/retrosystem) project, a web interface inspired by vintage operating systems.
